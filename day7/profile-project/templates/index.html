      <h2> <u> Biography </u> </h2>

       <p> Hi. My name is Kiet (pronounced Kit), I live here in Seattle,
          and I will be attending University of Washington (Seattle) with
          hopes of majoring in Computer Science. I like staying at home,
          manga, anime, Japanese anime music, Reddit, Top Gear (UK), and
          I've recently taken a liking to playing Sudoku when I'm waiting
          for the bus at bus stops. </p>

        <p> I'm a huge technology geek and to show that I've taken
          pride to my work space which has been updated year after
          year. I have 5 monitors in my room. 1 for surveillance
          outside my house, 3 for my computer, and one more for
          digital camera monitoring when filming videos. I have so
          many electrical outlets being used in my room that I'm afraid
          that someday my room will catch on fire. </p>

        <p> I've touched upon many things including video editing,
          photo editing, photography, designing, electrical, and programming. </p>

        <p> I'm an introvert and I never really "hang out" with
          people whenever I'm not in school so this will be an
          entirely new experience for me. I don't really know what
          to expect since this is so much outside my comfort zone
          but I hope I will learn a lot about myself from this.﻿ </p>
